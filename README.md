# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Model

This repository contains code for building a cryptocurrency price prediction model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The model is designed to forecast cryptocurrency prices based on historical data.
# Introduction

Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, making them challenging to predict. This project aims to develop a predictive model using deep learning techniques to forecast cryptocurrency prices. The model is based on LSTM neural networks, which are well-suited for sequence prediction tasks like time series forecasting.

## Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following libraries:

*TensorFlow
*Pandas
*NumPy
*Matplotlib
*Scikit-learn
*Plotly

**You can install these dependencies using pip:**
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn plotly

## Usage

1.Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.Install the required dependencies as mentioned above.
3.Run the Python scripts provided in the repository to train the model and make predictions.

## Model Architecture

The cryptocurrency price prediction model is built using a Sequential LSTM neural network. The architecture typically includes multiple LSTM layers followed by dense layers for prediction. Dropout layers may also be added to prevent overfitting.

## Plots

The repository includes plots generated during the model training and evaluation process. These plots visualize the training/validation loss, actual vs. predicted prices, and other relevant metrics.
